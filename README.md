###Tests

Test suite is Karma, Mocha, Chai. The default test run - `npm test` - runs Karma with PhantomJS.

**Writing Tests**

To add a tests for `foo.js`, create a `foo.test.js` file adjacent to `foo.js`. The karma will automatically pick up and run it.

If you're actively writing tests, you may want to debug them in a browser. 
Karma supports running tests in a browser, and auto-reloading test code when it changes. 
The following command starts Chrome and runs tests in the browser. You can debug it with Chrome dev tools.
```
npm run test:dev
```

**Adding Chai Plugins**

To add a Chai plugin, add the import and call of `chai.use(plugin)` to `config/chai/plugins.config` 


###Building for prod

Run the prod build within the gallery project.
```
cd gallery
npm run build:prod
```
